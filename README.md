# ChBoSync for Android
_ChBoSync_ is a free _SyncML client_ for Android based on Funambol's open source suite & the _PTBV SyncML Client_. 
The app can sync calendar entries, contacts & notes.

<br>

# Warning

**Before changing the password on your SyncML server (i.e. the password used by _ChBoSync_ for authentication) you should have no unsynced changes on any of your devices using SyncML. See [*this wiki page*](https://github.com/mide42/chbosync4android/wiki/Bug:-Behaviour-when-changing-password-on-server) for more details.**

## About the app

_ChBoSync_ was developed for synchronization with data on a _Horde server_, which is a groupware solution that supports the [_SyncML_](https://github.com/mide42/chbosync4android/wiki/SyncML) protocol. 
_ChBoSync_ should also work with other groupware solutions that support SyncML, but the only other server we tested was Funambol's own server.

<br>

Supported languages are English and German.

<br>

~~The app is available in Google's official app store _Google Play_ free of charge, [_see here_](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=de.chbosync.android.syncmlclient).~~

The publication of the app was suspended on 7th January 2018, because we found out that on newer Android releases the data on the server might get corrupted.


<br>

## Requirements:
 * Device with at least version 4.0.3 of Android (API level 15, _"Ice Cream Sandwich MR1"_).
 * An account on a SyncML server, e.g. [Horde](https://github.com/mide42/chbosync4android/wiki/Horde).
 * Optional: For synchronizing notes you have to install the free app [_OI Notepad_](https://github.com/mide42/chbosync4android/wiki/OI-Notepad).
